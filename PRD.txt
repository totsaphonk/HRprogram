1. 📌 Purpose & Objectives
The HR Leave Management System is a flexible, modern application designed to help organizations manage all aspects of employee leave — including entitlement rules, approval workflows, and recordkeeping. The system allows HR personnel and administrators to set up policies, assign roles, and adjust leave rules without requiring system developers, ensuring agility and long-term maintainability.

2. 🧑‍💼 User Roles
Role	Description
Employee	Request leave, view leave balance and history
Line Manager	Approve or reject leave requests submitted by subordinates
HR Admin	Manage leave types, leave rules, public holidays, and reports
System Admin	Manage users, assign roles, configure global system settings

3. 🧩 Functional Requirements (FR)
Code	Function	Description
FR-01	Organization Structure	Define and maintain departments, units, and reporting relationships
FR-02	Role-Based Access Control	Users are granted access by their assigned role (Employee, Manager, HR, Admin)
FR-03	Employee Master Data	Store and manage employee records such as name, department, join date, and employment type
FR-04	Leave Type Management	HR/Admin can create, edit, and disable various leave types (e.g., sick, annual, errand)
FR-05	Leave Entitlement Engine	Define and apply rules for leave entitlements based on years of service, employment type, or other conditions
FR-06	Leave Application (Full/Half Day)	Employees can apply for leave with options for full-day or half-day
FR-07	Approval Workflow Setup	HR/Admin can configure multi-step approval flows per department or leave type
FR-08	Leave Approval Process	Approvers can approve, reject, or return leave requests with comments
FR-09	Leave Balance Calculation	System calculates available leave dynamically based on policy and usage
FR-10	Leave History & Audit Trail	All actions (create, approve, reject) are logged and viewable historically
FR-11	Public Holiday Setup	HR/Admin can define holidays by year and region to exclude from leave count
FR-12	Team Calendar	Visual calendar showing all team member leaves in color-coded format
FR-13	Notifications & Alerts	Users receive email notifications about request status changes
FR-14	Reporting & Analytics	Downloadable and filterable reports of leave usage, approvals, balances
FR-15	Dynamic Form Settings	Admin can enable/disable fields for specific leave types (e.g., file upload)
FR-16	Self-Service Role Assignment	Admins can assign users to roles without IT support
FR-17	Leave Policy Versioning	Leave policy changes are tracked with effective dates and audit logs

FR-19: Organization Structure Management
The system must allow HR/Admin to create and manage a hierarchical organization structure, including:
Company → Division → Department → Team
Each employee must be assigned to a department or unit.
The structure should be viewable in tree or dropdown format.

FR-20: Position-Based Reporting Line
Each employee must be associated with their direct line manager (e.g., Employee A → Manager AA → GM).
The system should store this reporting line to determine approval routing.
Supports hierarchical reporting for leave approval.

FR-21: Dynamic Approval Routing Based on Organization
The system must automatically generate approval routes based on an employee’s organizational position:

Level 1: Direct Manager
Level 2: Department Head or GM
Level 3 (Optional): HR or Director
When an employee submits a leave request, the system should auto-assign approvers according to their department’s hierarchy.

FR-22: Configurable Approval Levels
HR/Admin must be able to configure how many approval levels are required (e.g., 1-step, 2-step).
Leave types may require different workflows (e.g., sick leave may only need 1-step, while personal leave may require 2-step).
Approvers may vary by leave type or department.

FR-23: Alternate Approver / Delegation
Approvers (e.g., Manager AA) must be able to assign a temporary delegate when they are unavailable.
Delegation period must have a defined start and end date.
During this time, the alternate approver has full authority to act on behalf of the original approver.
System should indicate that a delegate is acting on behalf of someone.

FR-24: Approver Substitution (Admin-Level)
HR/Admin must have the ability to manually override and reassign approvers in exceptional cases, such as:
Manager resignation or transfer
Long-term unavailability

FR-25: Approval Workflow Visualization
The system should clearly display the approval status at each level for every leave request, for example:
Employee → Manager AA (✔️ Approved) → GM (⏳ Pending)

✅ Additional Notes:
Approval assignments should be based on roles/positions, not hard-coded to specific people.
Notifications should be sent when a request is submitted, approved, rejected, or delegated.
Each approval or rejection should be timestamped and optionally commented for audit.
